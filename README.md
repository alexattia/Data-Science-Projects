# Online-Challenge
Challenge submitted on HackerRank and Kaggle.

Algorithm challenges are made on HackerRank using Python.

Data Science and Machine Learning challenges are made on Kaggle using Python too. 

## [Kaggle Bike Sharing](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleBikeSharing)
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts the count of bike shared, exclusively based on contextual features. The first part of this challenge was aimed to understand, to analyse and to process those dataset. I wanted to produce meaningful information with plots. The second part was to build a model and use a Machine Learning library in order to predict the count.

## [Twitter Parsing](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/TwitterParsing)

I've recently discovered the Chris Albon Machine Learning flash cards and I want to download those flash cards but the official Twitter API has a limit rate of 2 weeks old tweets so I had to find a way to bypass this limitation : use Selenium and PhantomJS.  
Purpose of this project : Check every 2 hours, if he posted new flash cards. In this case, download them and send me a summary email.

## [Face Recognition](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/FaceRecognition)

Modern face recognition with deep learning and HOG algorithm. Using dlib C++ library, I have a quick face recognition tool using few pictures (20 per person).

## [Playing with Soccer data](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleSoccer)

As a soccer fan and a data passionate, I wanted to play and analyze with soccer data.  
I don't know currently what's the aim of this project but I will parse data from diverse websites, for differents teams and differents players. 

## [NYC Taxi Trips](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleTaxiTrip)

Kaggle playground to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. 

## [Kaggle Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleAmazon) 
Use satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest.  
Deep Learning model (using Keras) to label satellite images.

## [Predicting IMDB movie rating](https://github.com/alexattia/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleMovieRating)
